      <h1>AlphaTON Set to Divest Cancer Treatment Subsidiary</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>Toncoin-oriented treasury firm AlphaTON is moving to divest its cancer treatment subsidiary, according to recent reports. While specifics about the deal—including the identity of the buyer and the terms of the transaction—have not been disclosed, this move represents a notable change in direction for AlphaTON.</p>
<p>The company has primarily focused on managing digital assets within the Toncoin ecosystem. Its venture into healthcare, through ownership of a cancer treatment subsidiary, was a departure from AlphaTON’s usual business. By divesting this unit, the company may be looking to re-center its attention on its main activities within blockchain finance and asset management.</p>
<p>The reasons behind AlphaTON’s decision to sell its healthcare business have not been made public. The company has yet to issue an official statement explaining the rationale for the move or its expected impact on overall strategy. It also remains unclear how long the subsidiary has been under AlphaTON’s ownership.</p>
<p>Responses within the industry are still developing as more details are awaited. For the moment, it is expected that AlphaTON will continue to prioritize projects and initiatives within the Toncoin network, in keeping with its stated focus.</p>
<p>As of now, details such as the transaction’s value, the future of the subsidiary, and the projected timeline for the sale have not been confirmed.</p>
