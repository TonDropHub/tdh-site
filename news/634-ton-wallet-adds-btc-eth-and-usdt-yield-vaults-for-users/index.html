      <h1>TON Wallet Adds BTC, ETH, and USDT Yield Vaults for Users</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>TON Wallet has introduced new features aimed at expanding its capabilities, now allowing users to access yield vaults for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT). This update broadens the range of assets that users can manage and earn yield on within the wallet.</p>
<p>With this change, users holding BTC, ETH, or USDT in their TON Wallet can deposit their assets into dedicated vaults designed to generate yield. These yield opportunities create a new option for users interested in earning more from their crypto holdings directly through the wallet interface.</p>
<p>The specifics of how these yield vaults operate, the exact yield strategies employed, or the potential return rates have not yet been officially detailed. It also remains unclear if there are minimum deposit amounts, lock-up periods, or fees associated with using the vaults.</p>
<p>This development highlights continued efforts to make TON Wallet a more versatile platform for digital asset management, offering services beyond simply holding or transferring tokens. For users of BTC, ETH, or USDT, the introduction of vault features provides an additional way to engage with their assets within the TON ecosystem.</p>
<p>As always, users should make sure they understand the platform’s terms and risks before using new financial features. Further details about the yield vaults are expected to be provided as the rollout continues.</p>
