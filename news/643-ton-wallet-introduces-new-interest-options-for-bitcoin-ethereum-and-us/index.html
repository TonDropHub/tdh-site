      <h1>TON Wallet Introduces New Interest Options for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>TON Wallet has rolled out new features that let users earn interest on major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether (USDT).</p>
<p>While the exact rates and terms have yet to be fully confirmed, this move shows that TON Wallet is looking to expand its offerings beyond simple storage and transfers. By introducing interest-earning options, the wallet aims to attract users who want to grow their crypto passively, without the need to move assets to other platforms.</p>
<p>The assets currently supported include some of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether’s stablecoin (USDT). Adding these highly recognized coins could appeal to a wide user base—especially those looking for more ways to make use of their crypto holdings without taking on significant risk or venturing into lesser-known tokens.</p>
<p>It’s still unclear how TON Wallet’s new options will stack up against other yield programs across the crypto industry, since specific details like interest rates, lock-up periods, and any associated fees have not been disclosed yet.</p>
<p>As TON’s ecosystem continues to grow, the introduction of interest-earning features may help it stand out among crypto wallets that focus on both user convenience and extra earning opportunities. Many in the crypto community are waiting to see further updates with more information about the rollout.</p>
<p>Updates will be provided as soon as the TON Wallet team releases more details.</p>
