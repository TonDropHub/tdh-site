      <p>Tomarket has announced a new opportunity for users on February 28, 2026, featuring its “Daily Combo” event. During this promotion, participants can instantly claim free $TOMA tokens.</p>
<p>The Daily Combo appears to be a recurring promotion, and this particular offer will only be available for a limited time. Those interested are encouraged to review any eligibility requirements carefully, as specific participation criteria and detailed steps have not yet been outlined.</p>
<p>$TOMA serves as Tomarket’s native token, and events like this are often designed to attract new users or increase engagement with the platform. However, the announcement has not specified how many tokens are available, nor has it clarified any restrictions or particular actions required to claim the offer.</p>
<p>Anyone looking to claim free $TOMA tokens should act quickly, since promotions like these are typically time-sensitive. Note that details about eligibility, exact rules, or the length of the claim window have yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>At this time, Tomarket has not provided additional information about future promotions or extra benefits tied to the Daily Combo offer. Further details may be shared as the event date approaches.</p>
