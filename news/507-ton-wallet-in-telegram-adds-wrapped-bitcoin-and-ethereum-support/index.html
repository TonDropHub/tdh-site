      <h1>TON Wallet in Telegram Adds Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum Support</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>Users of the wallet integrated within Telegram now have broader crypto options at their fingertips. The TON Wallet, previously focused on native TON tokens, has expanded its capabilities to support wrapped versions of both Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>This new development means that, alongside managing TON, users can now hold, transfer, and interact with assets pegged to the values of Bitcoin (wBTC) and Ethereum (wETH), all from within the same wallet. Wrapped assets are tokenized versions of cryptocurrencies that make it possible for these coins to be used on different blockchain platforms, increasing interoperability and accessibility.</p>
<p>The update is aimed at simplifying the experience for those who wish to manage multiple major cryptocurrencies without switching between different wallets or platforms. By including wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum support, the TON Wallet is taking another step toward providing broader digital asset solutions to its users.</p>
<p>Details about when the features will be widely available or if there are additional functions tied to this launch have not been confirmed. The precise process for obtaining and converting these wrapped tokens within the TON ecosystem has also not been fully explained.</p>
<p>For now, the expansion signals continued efforts by the TON Wallet team to create a more comprehensive environment for crypto enthusiasts within its application. More updates are expected as the rollout progresses.</p>
