      <h1>Self-Custodial TON Wallet Introduces Cross-Chain Deposit Feature</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>A new update has been rolled out for the self-custodial wallet linked to the TON ecosystem, making it easier for users to manage assets across different blockchains. This feature now allows users to deposit tokens from various chains directly into their TON-compatible wallet.</p>
<p>With the integration of cross-chain deposits, users can transfer assets from supported external networks without the need to rely on third-party services or bridges. This improvement is aimed at enhancing the overall user experience and flexibility for those who manage digital assets on TON.</p>
<p>The addition comes as the TON ecosystem continues to grow, reflecting demand for more advanced and secure wallet functionalities. As more individuals look for simple and secure ways to handle assets across different blockchains, this update offers a step forward in meeting those expectations.</p>
<p>At this time, specifics about which blockchains and tokens are supported within this cross-chain deposit function have not been fully detailed. Information about processing times, fees, or the technical approach behind the new capability was also not confirmed.</p>
<p>This latest update marks an ongoing effort to streamline digital asset management, hoping to provide the TON wallet community with tools that match the fast-changing landscape of blockchain technology.</p>
