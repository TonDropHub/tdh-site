      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>A new interactive campaign has been launched, inviting users to participate in digital activities such as tapping, spinning, and evolving, offering a chance to qualify for the upcoming $SPARKY airdrop.</p>
<p>Details about how the campaign works emphasize simple, repetitive tasks designed to boost community participation. Users are expected to tap, spin, or evolve within a particular app, though the specific platform has not been identified. The main objective for participants is to meet certain requirements that could make them eligible for $SPARKY token rewards.</p>
<p>Although there is growing excitement around the airdrop, details like the total size of the token pool, distribution schedule, and the exact criteria for qualification have yet to be confirmed. It is still unclear how many participants will receive $SPARKY tokens or how each activity will count toward eligibility.</p>
<p>Gamifying engagement through activities like taps and spins has become an increasingly popular trend in the digital token world. Projects are continuously searching for innovative ways to involve their communities and reward active users as they roll out new products.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in the $SPARKY airdrop is encouraged to keep an eye on official channels for updates and further campaign instructions. Make sure to review the eligibility requirements as more details emerge if you plan to participate.</p>
<p>At this time, few details about $SPARKY’s broader use or long-term goals have been provided, and further information has not yet been confirmed.</p>
