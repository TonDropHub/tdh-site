      <h1>AlphaTON Moves to Sell Cancer Treatment Business Amid Strategic Shift</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>Toncoin-focused treasury firm AlphaTON has reached an agreement to sell its cancer treatment subsidiary, marking a significant shift in the company’s business direction.</p>
<p>AlphaTON, best known for managing digital assets related to Toncoin, appears to be consolidating its focus with this decision. By divesting from healthcare, the company is likely prioritizing its primary activities within the digital asset and blockchain sectors.</p>
<p>Details regarding the buyer or the specific terms of the sale have not been disclosed. It is also unclear whether the transaction includes intellectual property, research teams, or ongoing projects associated with the subsidiary.</p>
<p>This change comes as several companies in the blockchain industry are reevaluating their business strategies and restructuring divisions that are no longer central to their main objectives. AlphaTON has not shared its reasons for the move publicly, nor has it commented on any potential effects the sale might have on its financial outlook or stakeholders.</p>
<p>For those tracking AlphaTON’s progress, this move could indicate further adjustments to the company’s long-term plans. However, until more information is released, the broader impact of this transaction on both AlphaTON and its former subsidiary remains uncertain.</p>
