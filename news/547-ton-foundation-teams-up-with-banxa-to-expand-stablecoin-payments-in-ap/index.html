      <h1>TON Foundation teams up with Banxa to expand stablecoin payments in APAC</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>The TON Foundation has announced a new partnership with Banxa, a payments infrastructure provider, aiming to boost the use of stablecoin payments across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.</p>
<p>Through this collaboration, users and businesses in APAC are expected to gain easier access to digital payments powered by blockchain technology. Banxa’s experience in developing on-and-off-ramp solutions for cryptocurrencies will play a key role in ensuring smoother user experiences within the TON ecosystem.</p>
<p>Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets such as the US dollar, offer a way to make digital payments with reduced volatility. By integrating Banxa’s services, the TON Foundation is looking to make these transactions more accessible and user-friendly for people and companies navigating digital assets in everyday transactions.</p>
<p>This move comes at a time when demand is growing for faster, more reliable payment solutions in the region. The partnership is set to focus on streamlining onboarding and payment processes, potentially making stablecoin transactions less complex for users across different APAC markets.</p>
<p>While further specifics on the scope of this partnership and the rollout timeline were not confirmed, the initiative represents another step towards broader adoption of blockchain-powered payments in Asia-Pacific.</p>
