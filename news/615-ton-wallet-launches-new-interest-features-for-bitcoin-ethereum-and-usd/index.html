      <h1>TON Wallet Launches New Interest Features for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>TON Wallet has introduced a new range of features aimed at giving users greater flexibility with their digital assets. Now, holders of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT can take advantage of interest-earning opportunities directly within the wallet.</p>
<p>The latest update is designed to offer users more options in managing their cryptocurrency. Rather than simply storing their assets, wallet users can now choose to generate interest by locking their funds with the platform’s new tools. This addition may be particularly attractive to those interested in passive income, especially long-term holders.</p>
<p>Currently, these interest options are available for three of the most widely used digital currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. However, specific details about interest rates, lock-up periods, or the underlying methods for generating returns have not yet been disclosed.</p>
<p>This development is part of a broader trend among digital wallets to offer banking-style services for cryptocurrencies, such as staking, lending, and savings features. As more users look for flexible ways to manage their portfolios, such wallet upgrades are becoming increasingly common in the industry.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in trying out the new features should carefully review the terms provided by TON Wallet and consider any associated risks before deciding to lock up their assets. More detailed information and clarifications from the wallet’s team are still awaited.</p>
