      <h1>TON to Disable Toncoin Bridge to Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain Starting May 10</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>The TON team has announced that it will discontinue the bridge service that allows users to transfer Toncoin (TON) between the TON blockchain and two major networks: Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain. The bridge will stop operating as of May 10.</p>
<p>After this date, users will no longer be able to move Toncoin between these networks using the official bridge. The team did not specify the reason for discontinuing the service, leaving it unclear whether the decision stems from technical, regulatory, or other strategic considerations.</p>
<p>Anyone currently using the bridge to transfer assets between TON, Ethereum, and BNB Smart Chain should complete any outstanding transactions before the cutoff. Details on how remaining assets will be handled after the bridge shuts down have not been provided.</p>
<p>This change does not affect the main functionalities of the TON blockchain or the use of Toncoin within its native environment. However, users who previously depended on cross-chain transactions to interact with services or dApps on Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain will need to find alternative solutions.</p>
<p>At this time, there are no announcements regarding a replacement bridge or alternative cross-chain service. Users are advised to follow official channels for any future updates or instructions related to cross-chain transactions.</p>
