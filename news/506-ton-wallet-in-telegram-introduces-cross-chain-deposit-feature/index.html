      <h1>TON Wallet in Telegram Introduces Cross-Chain Deposit Feature</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>TON Wallet, integrated within the popular messaging platform Telegram, has launched a new feature supporting cross-chain deposits. This development enables users to transfer assets from multiple blockchain networks into their TON Wallet, aiming to enhance flexibility and convenience for those managing digital assets.</p>
<p>With this new capability, users are no longer limited to deposits from The Open Network (TON) alone. Now, assets held on other blockchains can be sent directly into the TON Wallet, broadening its functionality and appeal. Such interoperability is becoming increasingly significant as users seek to manage a variety of digital currencies across different blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Official details on the specific blockchains currently supported for cross-chain deposits have not been confirmed. However, the update reflects ongoing efforts to make TON Wallet more adaptable and user-friendly, keeping pace with the rising interest in multi-chain digital asset management.</p>
<p>This enhancement comes as the broader blockchain landscape continues to evolve, with more initiatives aimed at integrating and ensuring compatibility between previously isolated blockchain networks. Allowing straightforward cross-chain deposits simplifies the transfer experience for users and strengthens TON Wallet&#x27;s role as a comprehensive tool for digital asset management.</p>
<p>As with any new feature, users are advised to consult official guidance on which networks are supported and follow security recommendations when utilizing cross-chain functionalities. More details about compatibility and transaction processes may be shared as the feature becomes available to additional users.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that this function is now live. Further information about potential future enhancements or broader support for other networks has not yet been announced.</p>
