      <h1>TON Blockchain Back Online After Disruption Linked to DOGS Token Airdrop</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p>The TON blockchain is operating normally again after a brief outage that was reportedly caused by overwhelming demand during the DOGS token airdrop. The network went down temporarily when a surge of users trying to claim DOGS tokens exceeded its capacity.</p>
<p>While the exact cause and duration of the service interruption haven&#x27;t been specified, normal service has been restored. The sudden influx of activity as users rushed to participate in the airdrop exposed some of the pressures blockchain networks can face during large-scale token distributions.</p>
<p>Anyone who took part in the DOGS token airdrop should be cautious and verify the authenticity of any claim links or wallet-related interactions, especially as high-traffic events can attract scammers. Sticking to reliable sources is the best way to keep your assets secure.</p>
